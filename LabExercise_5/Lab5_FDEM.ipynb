The objective of this lab exercise is to help students develop a better understanding of frequency-domain EM, with the help of the interactive apps that allow students to adjust model and survey parameters and simulate EM fields and fluxes. <br>\n\nAfter finishing this exercise, students will understand <br>\n* How the currents distribute in a homogenous halfspace;\n* How the frequecy affects the distribution of currents;\n* How the background conductivity affect the distribution of currents;\n* How varying the conductivity of a layer affects the currents;\n* How a near-surface layer affects the detection of a deep conductor.\n\nAuthor: Jiajia Sun at University of Houston, October 23rd, 2018."

Each layer can have a different electrical conductivity ($\\sigma$). However, a constant magnetic susceptibility ($\\chi$) is used for all layers; where $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space and $\\mu = \\mu_0 (1 +\\chi)$. The thicknesses of the top two layers are given by $h_1$ and $h_2$, respectively.\n\nFor the time domain EM experiment in this lab, a transient VMD (i.e., vertical magnetic dipole) source (*Tx*) is used to excite the Earth, and the Earth's TEM response (secondary magnetic field) is measured by a receiver (*Rx*). In practice, the transmitter and receiver may be placed near the Earth's surface or in the air. The receiver measures secondary fields at a variety of times after the source is shut off.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/geoscixyz/em_apps/blob/master/images/LayeredEarthTEM.png?raw=true\"></img>\n"

How does the maximum value of current density change when the resistivity is increased? Why is that?  <font color=red>**(10 points)**</font>\n<br>\n<font color = red>**HINT:**</font>: There are two ways to understand the change. One is to think about Ohm's law. The other is to remember that the induced current in the three-loop system is $I_2$ = - $\\frac{i\\omega M_{12}}{R+i\\omega L}I_1 e^{i\\omega t}$. (Please refer to Slide 74 of Week 5) Therefore, the magnitude of the induced current is $|I_2|$ = $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}\\frac{M_{12}}{L}I_1$, where $\\alpha = \\frac{\\omega L}{R}$ is the induction number as defined in Week 5.
