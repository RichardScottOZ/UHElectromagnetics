The goal of this lab is to help you develop a better undertanding of the important concepts related to DC resistivity, namely, currents, apparent resistivity and charges. <br>\n<br>\nAfter finishing this exercise, you will <br>\n1. be able to use Jupyter Notebooks;\n2. be able to run the interactive EM apps;\n3. be able to creat resistivity models;\n4. understand how currents flow in the subsurface for a DC survey;\n5. understand how charges are built up; and\n6. eventually develop a better understanding of the DC resistivity method. <br>\n\n\nAuthor: Jiajia Sun at University of Houston, September 6th, 2018."
