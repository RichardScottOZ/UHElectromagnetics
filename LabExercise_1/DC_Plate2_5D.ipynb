These changes can be measurable at the sufurface electrodes. \n\nHere, we focus on a plate target embedded in a halfspace, and investigate what is happening in the earth when static currents are injected. Different from the sphere case, which is symmetric, \"coupling\" between the Tx, target (conductor or resistor), and Rx will be significanlty different with various scenarios and geometries. \nUsing this app we can investigate what effect different targets and survey geometries have on the currents, electric fields, potentials, charges, and sensitivities."
